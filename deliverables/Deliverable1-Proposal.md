# CS 1980 
Spring Semester 2016

## DUE DATE: 22 JANUARY 2016

## Deliverable 1

For the first sprint, each group will need to determine initial user stories for the project, write a walking skeleton of the application, and determine a test plan and prioritization of user stories.  Additionally, you will turn in a paper with all of this information and how you decided upon the prioritization, test plan, user stories, etc.

## Format

For the first sprint, you will turn in:

1. A cover page, in the format described below
1. A backlog of user stories, ranked
2. A "walking skeleton" application available on GitHub
3. A general outline of the system design (e.g., language used? architecture? libraries needed? systems supported?)
3. A description of what you plan to test, what tools you think you will need, and why
4. A description of how you determined the user stories, and how you prioritized them

Each of these sections shall be CLEARLY MARKED (i.e. they should each have titles and start on their own page).

Format for cover page:
* The name of the project
* The names of the people in the group
* The date that it is due (22 JANUARY 2016)
* The title "PROJECT PROPOSAL"

User stories shall be in the Connextra template and provide good, user-level descriptions of user needs and wants.  User stories should be printed in order of priority.  It is NOT expected that you will complete every single user story, or even that these are the final versions of the user story; they may change and be prioritized differently as the sprints go on.

User stories should flow from the needs of the customer.  Your discussions with the customer should guide the user stories themselves as well as their prioritization.

The number of user stories will vary based on the project, but it should be at least eight at the VERY minimum.  If there are fewer than eight stories, the project may be too small or your user stories too big.

The walking skeleton __must__ compile and show some minimal output (this can be as simple as a debug statement, "Hello, World!" on the console, etc.)  You can have more, but it is essential that your program compiles and runs without error!

The walking skeleton __must__ be able to run on __everybody's__ computer!  Everybody should have access to the repository on GitHub and able to make commits by the end of this sprint.

The test outline should be at least several paragraphs explaining what sorts of things you think will need to be tested, and why.  Remember to include functional and non-functional aspects (reliability, scalability, performance, etc)!

The description of decisions should be, at an absolute minimum, one page of text.  It should include any background research you did on the domain, your interactions with the customer, and your team's opinions on prioritization.  Be sure to include any __disagreement__ your team had internally!  Software engineering is rarely without some sort of disagreement about the direction of the software. 

Yes, grammar and spelling count.  Points will be deducted for more than one grammatical or spelling error per section.

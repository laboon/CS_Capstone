# CS CAPSTONE
Spring Semester 2016

## DUE DATE: 22 APRIL 2016

## FINAL PAPER

This final paper is required for all students in the Capstone, including internship (CS 1900) students.

## FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS

The paper must be 8 - 12 pages in length, using a relatively standard font and point size (e.g., 12-point Times New Roman or Computer Modern).  Judicious use of charts, graphs, and/or illustrations is acceptable.  Margins should be of standard size.

Please ensure that your name as well as the name of the project you worked on is listed, along with your faculty advisor (whoever signed your Faculty Learning Agreement, or your research advisor).

This is an individual project, even though you may have worked on a project with a group.

## DETAILS

The final paper should describe what you did for the capstone, and how you did it.  This will obviously vary dramatically based on if you did a research project, a Project Studio project, an internship, etc.  Thus, it is difficult to give a broad-enough description of what is required for all of these.  Consider the following as a list of possible topics to discuss, not as a checklist.

1. What programming language did you use?  Why?
2. Were there things about the choice of language you liked?  Disliked?
3. What frameworks did you use?
4. How did you handle clarifying requirements?
5. What technical problems did you face?
6. How did you ensure quality code?
7. What kind of testing did you do?
8. What was the development process like?
9. How did you communicate with other developers/testers/customers/etc?
10. Did you have non-technical problems that you had to face?
11. What were the biggest challenges you faced during the capstone?
12. Were you able to take what you learned during the capstone and apply it to classes?  Conversely, were you able to use what you learned in class for the capstone project?
13. How did you design the software you were writing?
14. Did you present the project to customers?  How did you plan for it?
15. What was day-to-day life like?
16. Did you have a mentor?  What did they teach you?
17. What was the worst part of the capstone project?
18. How did you deal with ambiguity in requirements or direction?
19. Did you learn any interesting skills during the capstone project?

In general, what I would like to see is a good understanding of what you did, and what you learned, doing the work for the capstone.  If you worked on anything sensitive (e.g., for a government contractor or private data for a company), you do not need to refer to it in your write-up.  If there is any doubt, you may wish to show your manager the paper so that they may review it.

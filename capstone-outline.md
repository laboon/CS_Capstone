## Course Information

**Taught by:** Bill Laboon (bill.laboon@pitt.edu)  
**Professor's Office Hours:** SENSQ 6305
* Thursday 2:30-4:00 PM
* Wednesday 1:30-2:45 PM
* or by appointment.  

_NOTE: For those of you heading to Project Studio, you will be meeting with representatives from the company with whom you are working (NetApp or FedEx).  This schedule will most likely not apply to you unless they decide that you should follow it.  You will also need to drop CS1980 and add CS1981 (they are worth the same credits)._

Details on Assignments:

Proposal Paper -
This should include:
  * A brief description of the project you are working on
  * A prioritized listing of user stories to be implemented
  * A broad outline of the design of the software
    * Architecture?
    * Language?
    * Supported systems?
    * Testing?
    * A UML diagram would be nice, but not strictly necessary
    * Note that this subject to change as the semester continues!
  * Approximately 5 - 8 pages
  
Additionally, a "walking skeleton" version of the software should be completed at this point.

Mid-Semester Checkpoint -
  * A brief description of decisions made and challenges faced so far
    * Approximately 1 - 2 pages
  * A _working_ demo of the software
    * Note that the software does not have to be fully functional, but should be "presentable"

Final Project Presentation -
  * A five to ten-minute demo of the software you developed
  * Include features and technical decisions
  * Especially discuss trade-offs made
  
Final Project Paper
  * An 8 to 12 page paper discussing:
    * Challenges developing the software
    * Features added
    * Prioritization
    * Defects found and fixed
    * Design (modifications from initial design?)
    * Trade-offs made
    * Environment (how did you meet? communicate? discuss? assign work? etc.)

## Details on Project Development:

The goal of this course is to develop a project, from start to finish, using modern software engineering tools and techniques.  The final project should be _well-written, well-tested, and well-documented_.  

Unless dictated otherwise by the customer, work should be done using Git and GitHub.  Work should be done in a private repository.  Please sign up for a student developer pack (which includes five free private repositories, along with other free software) here: https://education.github.com/pack

Unless dictated otherwise by the customer, the project will be developed using the Agile/Scrum software design methodology.  We will discuss this more in class.  One of the key tenets is that there is always some "working" version of the software, even if it does not include all of the features.  This means that at any point, you should have a working version of the software to show customers (and professors)!

We will consider each class meeting the end of each sprint.  During this time, we will spend some time doing a retrospective in your groups - meeting for twenty minutes or so, in-person, to determine what went well with the last sprint and what could go better.  You will also come up with a plan for the next sprint.  Professor Laboon will be available at the end of each lecture to discuss the path forward with each group.  

Since student schedules are often hard to reconcile, I recommend you use a chat application such as Slack or HipChat to stay in touch with each other, even when you cannot meet in person.

As this is a capstone course, you are expected to be self-motivated and independent.  This may mean learning a new language, framework, architecture, etc.  Professional software engineers are often expected to learn these things independently, and you should be prepared to do so as well.  If you are unfamiliar with where to find training materials or information for a particular subject, you may discuss it with Professor Laboon, but the onus is entirely on you to learn anything additional you need to know to complete the project.
